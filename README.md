## What does it do?

It creates a `.pem` file for client certs and unencrypted private keys from of the given `.p12` file, then verifies it, using [`openssl`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/openssl-pkcs12.html) and finally outputs the contents of the `.pem` file.

This is a simple function. It isn't very tolerant to fault.


## Prerequisite

You need to download and install [`openssl`](https://www.openssl.org). In most cases, you don't need to do this as your operating system already ships with it.

## Setup

1. Follow the [Prerequisite](#prerequisite) instructions.

2. Clone this repository.
    ```sh
	git clone https://github.com/csantarin/openssl_p12_to_pem.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the repostitory folder.
	```sh
	cd <path/to/the/parent/of/your/local/copy>/openssl_p12_to_pem
	```

4. Expose the `openssl_p12_to_pem` function to command line.

	```sh
	source ./openssl_p12_to_pem.sh 
	```

5. Follow the [Linking](#linking) instructions to add this command to your command line permanently.

## Usage

Call the newly-installed `openssl_p12_to_pem` command.

```sh
# Call the function and provide an input file name
# - Include the trailing .p12 extension.
# - Include a path (relative or absolute) if necessary.
openssl_p12_to_pem <path/to/your/file>.p12
```

Example:

```sh
$ openssl_p12_to_pem ../my-project/aps_cert.p12

Processing ../my-project/aps_cert.p12 ...

open_ssl_p12_to_pem: [1] Creating .pem file from .p12 file...

Enter Import Password: # Your .p12's password, if you've specified it.

## Linking

In case you don't want to constantly `source` the same same command over and over, you can link the script.

### First step: Know your environment

You should locate where your shell environment is.

Assumptions in the subsequent parts:
- Shell environment file: `.zshrc`
- Location: user home directory (`~`. In the following, it represents the `/Users/csantarin` folder).

#### Option 1: Via utility script

There's a `link.sh` file that can do this for you.

```sh
sh ./link.sh ~/zshrc
```

Result:

```
Retrieving this repository's working directory ...
/Users/csantarin/openssl_p12_to_pem

Adding to /Users/csantarin/.zshrc ...
Done!
```

#### Option 2: By hand

Copy this to your shell environment file.

```sh
source ~/openssl_p12_to_pem/openssl_p12_to_pem.sh
```

### Final step: Apply changes

`source` the changes immediately or launch a new command line session:

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```
